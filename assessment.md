# Assessment

This course focusses on developing a critical approach to problem solving using systems engineering methodologies in a group environment. Different people learn in different ways, and accordingly the experience of the assessment will be slightly different for each student. This is reflected in the assessment below.

## Generalised Criteria <a id="Generalised_Criteria"></a>

There are detailed criteria for each assessment piece. However, John Biggs' Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy is a useful framework for thinking about your work. In this course, where the tasks are often open-ended, students are especially encouraged to operate in the Relational and Extended Abstract domains of the taxonomy.

We will talk about this during classes and meetings, but if you have any questions please raise them.

# Group Project Guide <a id="Group_Project_Guide"></a>

There are several parts to this assessment item. These should be completed in your project groups. Note that the Group Project will have a peer evaluation process, completed in Wk12 tutorials.

## Project Concept Document
Your project team is asked to present a short scoping document for your design problem. These ideas will form the base for your project throughout the semester. Note that you are not bound to these ideas, and it is expected that they will evolve over the semester.

### Task Requirements
Present a written 2-page PCD, and lead a 10-minute roundtable discussion. You may use 2 slides if you need to to help the discussion (for example, a picture of your design to date). The PCD should include aspects in the template, including:

*  Project title, client, mentor, members
*  A Use Case for the problem
*  Identification of stakeholders and potential collaborators
*  A plan for completing the design task, including the identification of potential issues

The template can be modified as necessary. Use it as a guide.

*  [PCD (Word Document)](data/project_concept_document.doc)
*  [PCD (PDF)](data/project_concept_document.pdf)

### Feedback
No marks are allocated to this assessment piece, but you will receive feedback to improve your final presentation.

  * Demonstrate that the ideas address the design problem
  * Feasibility of adoption of the idea
  * Quality and professionalism of discussion

### Submission
Please come to your tutorial with presentations, and 10 copies of your PCD to share around the room.

## Project Report
The draft project report is a document that you will build with your group each week over the semester. The final report will be given to the client, and should be a representation of your group's best work over the semester.

There are two parts to the document:

  - A weekly progress document
  - A weekly group exercise that demonstrates how the theory applies to your project. This will evolve to become your Group Project Report. Consider the Individual Research paper as serving the background/evidence for weekly homework (and therefore the group report).

### Weekly Progress Document <a id="WPD"></a>

The weekly progress document is a 'control' document that demonstrates your group's progress, and highlights any issues that your group might be having. Please bring a copy each week, and bring previous weeks' reports too.

The weekly group exercise demonstrates how your group is applying the theory to your project. Use the documents below. Your group can adapt the document after consulting with your tutor.

*  [Weekly Progress Report (Word Document)](data/project_weekly_progress.doc)
*  [Weekly Progress Report (OpenOffice Document)](data/project_weekly_progress.odt)
*  [Weekly Progress Report (Pages Document)](data/project_weekly_progress.pages)

### Group Project Report (aka TUTORIAL HOMEWORK) and Roundtable Presentation <a id="GPR"></a>

Your final report should be an 'evolved' compilation of your weekly homework exercises. The weekly homework exercises should be completed as a group, but should have strong links to the Individual Research Paper on that topic. Please bring your homework exercise to each tutorial, but your group may choose to improve and develop these ideas during the semester for the Final Report.

The Group Project Report will be made available to the project clients in meetings at the conclusion of the course.

The weekly homework exercise (and the final report) should be 1-2 pages for each topic. The final report should be a professional compilation of these of no more than 15 pages.

**List of weekly homework exercises *(do these beforehand and bring these to the tutorial)*:**

*  **Wk 4 Tutorial:** Project Concept Document
*  **Wk 5 Tutorial:** Human Factors Analysis
*  **Wk 6 Tutorial:** Queue Theory
*  **Wk 7 Tutorial:** Multi-Factorial Design
*  **Wk 8 Tutorial:** Life-Cycle Audit
*  **Wk 9 Tutorial:** Energy-Mass Balance Plan
*  **Wk 10 Tutorial:** Economic Analysis
*  **Wk 11 Tutorial:** Design Sketch/Model and explanation (as a group)
*  **Wk 12 Tutorial:** Final Design Report (as a group)
  
Each week, apply the **Fundamental Theory** to the topic in relation to your group project. For example, in Week 5:

*  The weekly topic is Human Factors, with subtopics of anthropometrics, ergonomics and workplace comfort.
*  The Fundamental Theory (listed on the [Content](../../content/) page is 'Dispersion in population data'
*  If my project was, for example, an Electric Car, I could apply population data about height to understand how far the seat should be able to move back and forth to fit (for example) 95% of the population.

You could use the following template, or evolve your own:

*  [Weekly Homework template (Word Document)](data/weekly_homework.doc)
*  [Weekly Homework template (OpenOffice.org Document)](data/weekly_homework.odt)
*  [Weekly Homework template (Apple Pages Document)](data/weekly_homework.pages)

### Marking Criteria

Each week, your group will have a meeting with your tutor to report group progress. Feedback will inform the expectations for following weeks. In the Week 12 tutorial, you will be asked to give a peer evaluation of this exercise over the entire semester, which will moderate individual marks.

The final mark will be made up of three parts, totalling 25%.

*  Weekly Exercise and Progress (10%)
*  Final Project Report (10%)
*  Roundtable Presentation at end of semester (5%)

Each have the common criteria:

*  quality and professionalism of the exercise
*  extent to how the exercise relates the theory to your project
*  clarity and conciseness of the 'insight' from the exercise
  
### Submission
Weekly Homework/Progress Report submission should be made weekly in your tutorial group to your tutor. Submit at the beginning of the tutorial, and your tutor will meet with you in the second hour. Note that this exercise doubles as preparation for your tutorial, and should be completed as a group. A hard copy is required of both the Progress Document and the Weekly Exercise. Submissions should include previous weeks' submissions (ie. it should build up each week).  


# Jigsaw Tasks

## Tutorial Facilitation Guide <a id="Tutorial_Facilitation_Guide"></a>

In this activity, you're being asked to become a (relative) expert in your topic, and then co-facilitate the topic to your peers in groups of (approximately) four. 

There are three components to this assessment piece. As a topic facilitator, you will lead the development of the weekly homework for your group along with the person doing their Individual Research Paper. These activities tie in together strongly.

The stages for this assessment piece are:

  * Theory Workshop
  * Secret Plan (5%)
  * Tutorial Co-Facilitation (10%)

You will pick your facilitation topic in the Week 2 tutorial.

If you are interested on how 'student-facilitated' tutorials came into this course, I stole them from [ANU Professor Richard Baker](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/baker-rm). You can read [his paper on the idea on his personal webpage](http://fennerschool-people.anu.edu.au/richard_baker/teaching/webpapers/supertut/index.html). 

### Theory Workshop <a id="Theory_Workshop"></a>
This activity is run by Chris, and will guide you through important aspects of the theory and of running a good tutorial. You'll also work with your co-facilitators on how you're going to run your tutorial.

#### Task Overview
We'll go through aspects of:

*  what are the important theory components that you should cover
*  what makes a good/bad tutorial
*  how should you structure your tutorial
*  what you need to do to prepare

By the end of the workshop, you should be able to report:

*  an outline of your 'secret' facilitation plan, including activities and timings
*  a shared SMART+ Goal (a goal in one-sentence that is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely and Positive)
*  a shared relevant Engineering Case study that you can use to help tutorial members engage with the topic

#### Preparation
As preparation for the Workshop, please post to the Workshop Ideas Forum before attending. 

The question is a response to: *"How could you effectively teach this topic?" Please make reference to a relevant case study, activity or other suitable resources.*

**This workshop and preparation is not marked, but is compulsory. If you cannot attend the workshop, then you will not be allowed to facilitate the topic, and will be given a mark of 0% for the Co-Facilitation.**

#### Submission
Attendance will be recorded to ensure that all co-facilitators have completed the activity.

### Tutorial Co-Facilitation and Secret Plan <a id="Tutorial_Co-Facilitation"></a>
This is the actual facilitation during your tutorial slot. Your tutor will act as a guide if necessary, and will mark your facilitation during the session. ***Use your tutor*** - they are a (very) valuable resource!

#### Task Overview

*  your Secret Plan should be a 1-page 'agenda' of the facilitation, including activities, allocation of roles and fall-back options (note you do not need to stick strictly to the plan, but it should provide a good 'back-bone' to your facilitation.
*  your facilitation should run for between 60-65 minutes (should finish no later than ten past the second hour).
*  you should cover the topics for the week in an interesting and relevant way, with an emphasis on building on the homework, and covering the other 'topics' in the week.
*  your group can expect that everyone has at least done the tutorial homework for their group project (see [Weekly Group Exercise]())

#### Marking Criteria
You will receive a group mark for this assessment item, which will be moderated by your peers. There are two marks awarded: 10% for the facilitation, and 5% for your completed Secret Plan.

Your group will be marked by your tutor according to the following criteria:

  * encourages participation of all tutorial members
  * extent to which the facilitators build a shared understanding of the theory
  * extends the topic through the use of an engineering case study
  * effective time management
  * clear, logical progression of ideas which leads to an effective conclusion

#### Resources
Chris will give you a handout throughout the tutorial specific to your week's topic. You can download a [basic version of this workshop handout.](assessment/workshopplain.pdf)

#### Submission and Feedback
You must give a hard copy of your Secret Plan to your tutor at the beginning of your tutorial. Your tutor will mark the facilitation throughout the tutorial, and will offer initial feedback and allow peer feedback. Your group will get written feedback and marks at the following tutorial.


## Research Paper Guide<a id="Research_Paper_Guide"></a>

The research paper is submitted over a number of weeks to get to a great final paper.

*  One week before the topic - submit a Structured Abstract
*  Week of topic - submit a Draft for Peer Review (the more complete the better)
*  One week after topic - submit a final paper and Peer Review Critique

### Structured Abstract <a id="Structured_Abstract"></a>
This activity is designed to give you early feedback on your thinking in the individual Research Paper. It doubles as your preparation for your group's homework.

#### Task Requirements
Your Individual Research Paper asks you to apply your project to your research paper topic. This Structured Abstract should be a 'proposal' of how you plan to do this. It should include:

*  a relevant title
*  an indication of whether you will present a final paper or a draft paper + poster
*  author details
*  a short description of how the theory could be applied to your group's design problem. *This could be dot-points, diagrams with captions, or text*
  *  the template asks you for a few sentences on: *Context, Purpose or Goal, Approach, Actual or Anticipated Outcomes, Conclusions/Recommendations/Summary, References*
*  at least one journal article that you will use, including a rationale explaining why it is a relevant resource (one that is not listed on the topic's page)

Submission must be by PDF, and the outline must not exceed two A4 pages. If you have a draft table, schematic or diagram, you may attach it on an additional page - but please pose a question for feedback with it.

Please use the Structured Abstract template. You may alter and adjust if necessary.

*  [Word template](data/structured_abstract.doc)
*  [OpenOffice template](data/structured_abstract.odt)
*  [Pages template](data/structured_abstract.pages)
*  [LaTeX template](data/structured_abstract.zip)

#### Marking Criteria
All criteria have equal weight.

  * demonstrates that all Task Requirements have been met
  * demonstrates a correct understanding of the theory
  * application of the theory to the project
  * quality and relevance of journal article

#### Submission
Submission is required by 10am Monday the week before the topic. A small amount of written feedback and mark will be emailed to you by the following Thursday. You can access more feedback from Chris by attending a Consultation session.

### Individual Research Paper or Poster <a id="Individual_Research_Paper_or_Poster"></a>
The Individual Research Paper extends the Structured Abstract and supports your Group Project Report. As your Group Project Report is essentially the 'findings' of your group's investigations, the Individual Research Paper should supply the background for these findings. (Note that it is expected that projects will evolve, and that this relationship might decouple).

#### Task Requirements - Paper Option
The Individual Research Paper should be a case study application of the theory to your project.

This paper should include:

*  a relevant title
*  author details
*  a short abstract (150 words) to orientate the reader to your topic and your design problem
*  evidence of how the theory has been applied in other situations (a short Literature Review)
*  relevant diagrams/analyses to help illustrate the argument (this may well be your group's homework, but not necessarily)
*  an application/discussion of the theory topic to your project
*  a bibliography including high-quality references, using the Harvard referencing system
*  a half-page 'critique' of the Peer Review comments you received from your Draft (not included in your word count)

Submission must be by PDF. The research paper content should not exceed 1,500 words, not including the bibliography. The paper should be between 4-5 pages, excluding the bibliography. You could include calculations/extended diagrams in an Appendix, but please don't expect the Appendix to be read (i.e. - put anything important in the paper).

Please use the Individual Research Paper template. You may alter and adjust if necessary.

*  [Word template](data/individual_research_paper.doc)
*  [OpenOffice template](/data/individual_research_paper.odt)
*  [Pages template](data/individual_research_paper.pages)
*  [LaTeX template](data/individual_research_paper.zip)

#### Task Requirements - Draft Paper + Poster Option
After submitting your draft paper for peer review, you might like to submit a Poster of your research instead of a final paper. 

The guidelines for a poster are:

*  a relevant title
*  author details
*  a clear problem statement
*  evidence of how the theory has been applied in other situations (a short Literature Review)
*  relevant diagrams/analyses to help illustrate the argument (this may well be your group's homework, but not necessarily)
*  an application/discussion of the theory topic to your project
*  a bibliography including high-quality references, using the Harvard referencing system

Submission must be by PDF. Posters should be A1 in size (841 x 594 mm), and communicate the ideas clearly. If you submit by poster, please also submit:

*  your Draft Paper (must be complete)
*  a half-page 'critique' of the Peer Review comments you received from your Draft (not included in your word count)

#### Marking Criteria
All criteria have equal weight

  * demonstrates that all Task Requirements have been met
  * demonstrates a correct understanding of the theory
  * application of the theory to the project
  * quality and relevance of bibliography

#### Submission
Submission of your draft is required by 5pm Monday the week of the topic. This is to allow time for the Peer Reviewers to provide comments by Friday of the topic week. 

The final paper is due Friday the week after your facilitation on WATTLE. Your research paper will be marked by your tutor.


## Peer Review
You will be allocated two Individual Research Papers to Peer Review. This should assist the author improve their thinking about their paper.

### Task Requirements
Read the author's paper, and complete a short questionnaire to assist the author improve. The task should take about 30 minutes.

### Marking Criteria
You will be awarded a mark for each of the two peer reviews you complete. You will receive a mark on how useful the peer review was for the author on the following scale:

*  2.5 marks - peer review was really useful in improving or confirming author assumptions and approach to the paper, and provided constructive encouragement and avenues (i.e. further references) to thoroughly enhance the paper.
*  2.0 marks - peer review comments on useful parts of the paper
*  1.5
*  1.0
*  0.5
*  0.0 - epic fail, or nil submission.

### Submission
Submission will be available on WATTLE - please complete the activity there. (Should take less than 30 minutes if you're across the content.)

# Portfolio
The Core Competencies Portfolio is an opportunity for individuals to showcase their understanding and extension of themes and concepts in the course.

**As much as possible, you should look for a technology theme that you can get hands-on with. Think of using the 'Think, Plan, Do, Invent' loops to demonstrate your learning (teardowns, builds, repairs, reflections encouraged!)**

### Task Requirements

There is no clear format for this assessment piece. Creativity and insights based on applications are encouraged. You should use the weekly group homework as a starting point, but you're not restricted to a report. You will have a meeting with Chris in week 5 to discuss and navigate your approach to this assessment piece.

The Core Competencies Portfolio should:

*  have a common technology theme<br />*You should not choose a theme that is a copy of your group project. You could, however, laterally explore technologies to inform your project if you wish. You can discuss this with Chris in your Week 5 meeting if you are unsure. You can, of course, choose a technology not related to your project. Most importantly, you should choose a technology that interests you.*
*  contain insightful analysis that demonstrates your understanding of the course content<br />*You should choose between 4-8 analysis techniques from the course and apply the theory to your technology. You must choose topics that you didn't facilitate or write your research paper on.*
*  be a professional representation (if you're writing a report, it should be of 10-15 pages in length, developed over the semester). However, if you would like to present your portfolio in an alternative format, please raise this with Chris in the Week 5 meeting.

### Marking Criteria
This is a significant part of the course mark. To benefit different learning styles and differentiate understanding of course concepts, there are three aspects to this submission:

*  Portfolio artefact (20%)<br /><em>i.e. the document</em>
*  Portfolio discussion and defence (10%)<br />*A 10-min walkthrough of your document, which will include questions and answers of aspects of your Portfolio.*

### Submission
There will be a Week 5 meeting with Chris to bounce ideas around for your Portfolio. You should bring a plan to help guide your plan. Sign up for a spot on WATTLE.

Please submit a PDF of your Portfolio on WATTLE.

Sign up for a Week 13 discussion spot on WATTLE.
