This course focusses on developing a critical approach to problem solving using systems engineering methodologies in a group environment. Different people learn in different ways, and accordingly the experience of the assessment will be slightly different for each student. This is reflected in the assessment below.

Please also note the [Generalised Criteria](#Generalised_Criteria) - it is a key concept of all assessment and marking.

## Generalised Criteria <a id="Generalised_Criteria"></a>

There are detailed criteria for each assessment piece. However, John Biggs' Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy is a useful framework for thinking about your work. In this course, where the tasks are often open-ended, students are especially encouraged to operate in the Relational and Extended Abstract domains of the taxonomy.

We will talk about this during classes and meetings, but if you have any questions please raise them.

# Group Project Guide <a id="Group_Project_Guide"></a>

There are several parts to this assessment item. These should be completed in your project groups.

*  [Project Concept Document (PCD) and Roundtable](#PCD)
*  [Group Project Report (Drafts, Final and Roundtable)](#GP)
  * [Weekly Progress Document](#PCD)
  * [Group Project - AKA Weekly Homework](#GPR)

Note that the Group Project will have a peer evaluation process, completed in Wk12 tutorials.

## Project Concept Document (PCD) and roundtable <a id="PCD"></a>
Your project team is asked to present a short scoping document for your design problem. These ideas will form the base for your project throughout the semester. Note that you are not bound to these ideas, and it is expected that they will evolve over the semester.

### Task Requirements
Present a written 2-page PCD, and lead a 10-minute roundtable discussion. You may use 2 slides if you need to to help the discussion (for example, a picture of your design to date). The PCD should include aspects in the template, including:

*  Project title, client, mentor, members
*  A Use Case for the problem
*  Identification of stakeholders and potential collaborators
*  A plan for completing the design task, including the identification of potential issues

The template can be modified as necessary. Use it as a guide.

*  [PCD (Word Document)](../../data/project_concept_document.doc)
*  [PCD (PDF)](../../data/project_concept_document.pdf)

### Feedback
No marks are allocated to this assessment piece, but you will receive feedback to improve your final presentation.

  * Demonstrate that the ideas address the design problem
  * Feasibility of adoption of the idea
  * Quality and professionalism of discussion

### Submission
Please come to your tutorial with presentations, and 10 copies of your PCD to share around the room.

## Project Report (and Progress Reports) <a id="GP"></a>
The draft project report is a document that you will build with your group each week over the semester. The final report will be given to the client, and should be a representation of your group's best work over the semester.

There are two parts to the document:

  - A weekly progress document
  - A weekly group exercise that demonstrates how the theory applies to your project. This will evolve to become your Group Project Report. Consider the Individual Research paper as serving the background/evidence for weekly homework (and therefore the group report).

### Weekly Progress Document <a id="WPD"></a>

The weekly progress document is a 'control' document that demonstrates your group's progress, and highlights any issues that your group might be having. Please bring a copy each week, and bring previous weeks' reports too.

The weekly group exercise demonstrates how your group is applying the theory to your project. Use the documents below. Your group can adapt the document after consulting with your tutor.

*  [Weekly Progress Report (Word Document)](../../data/project_weekly_progress.doc)
*  [Weekly Progress Report (OpenOffice Document)](../../data/project_weekly_progress.odt)
*  [Weekly Progress Report (Pages Document)](../../data/project_weekly_progress.pages)

### Group Project Report (aka TUTORIAL HOMEWORK) and Roundtable Presentation <a id="GPR"></a>

Your final report should be an 'evolved' compilation of your weekly homework exercises. The weekly homework exercises should be completed as a group, but should have strong links to the Individual Research Paper on that topic. Please bring your homework exercise to each tutorial, but your group may choose to improve and develop these ideas during the semester for the Final Report.

The Group Project Report will be made available to the project clients in meetings at the conclusion of the course.

The weekly homework exercise (and the final report) should be 1-2 pages for each topic. The final report should be a professional compilation of these of no more than 15 pages.

**List of weekly homework exercises *(do these beforehand and bring these to the tutorial)*:**

<dl>
<dt>Wk 4 Tutorial</dt><dd>Project Concept Document</dd>
<dt>Wk 5 Tutorial</dt><dd>Human Factors Analysis</dd>
<dt>Wk 6 Tutorial</dt><dd>Queue Theory</dd>
<dt>Wk 7 Tutorial</dt><dd>Multi-Factorial Design</dd>
<dt>Wk 8 Tutorial</dt><dd>Life-Cycle Audit</dd>
<dt>Wk 9 Tutorial</dt><dd>Energy-Mass Balance Plan</dd>
<dt>Wk 10 Tutorial</dt><dd>Economic Analysis</dd>
<dt>Wk 11 Tutorial</dt><dd>Design Sketch/Model and explanation (as a group)</dd>
<dt>Wk 12 Tutorial</dt><dd>Final Design Report (as a group)</dd>
</dl>
  
Each week, apply the **Fundamental Theory** to the topic in relation to your group project. For example, in Week 5:

*  *The weekly topic is Human Factors, with subtopics of anthropometrics, ergonomics and workplace comfort.*
*  *The Fundamental Theory (listed on the [Content](../../content/) page is 'Dispersion in population data'*
*  *If my project was, for example, an Electric Car, I could apply population data about height to understand how far the seat should be able to move back and forth to fit (for example) 95% of the population.*

You could use the following template, or evolve your own:

*  [Weekly Homework template (Word Document)](../../data/weekly_homework.doc)
*  [Weekly Homework template (OpenOffice.org Document)](../../data/weekly_homework.odt)
*  [Weekly Homework template (Apple Pages Document)](../../data/weekly_homework.pages)

### Marking Criteria

Each week, your group will have a meeting with your tutor to report group progress. Feedback will inform the expectations for following weeks. In the Week 12 tutorial, you will be asked to give a peer evaluation of this exercise over the entire semester, which will moderate individual marks.

The final mark will be made up of three parts, totalling 25%.

*  Weekly Exercise and Progress (10%)
*  Final Project Report (10%)
*  Roundtable Presentation at end of semester (5%)

Each have the common criteria:

*  quality and professionalism of the exercise
*  extent to how the exercise relates the theory to your project
*  clarity and conciseness of the 'insight' from the exercise
  
### Submission
Weekly Homework/Progress Report submission should be made weekly in your tutorial group to your tutor. Submit at the beginning of the tutorial, and your tutor will meet with you in the second hour. Note that this exercise doubles as preparation for your tutorial, and should be completed as a group. A hard copy is required of both the Progress Document and the Weekly Exercise. Submissions should include previous weeks' submissions (ie. it should build up each week).
