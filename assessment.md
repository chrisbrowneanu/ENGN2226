This course focusses on developing a critical approach to problem solving using systems engineering methodologies in a group environment. Different people learn in different ways, and accordingly the experience of the assessment will be slightly different for each student. This is reflected in the assessment below.

Please also note the [Generalised Criteria](#Generalised_Criteria) - it is a key concept of all assessment and marking.

## Generalised Criteria <a id="Generalised_Criteria"></a>

There are detailed criteria for each assessment piece. However, John Biggs' Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy is a useful framework for thinking about your work. In this course, where the tasks are often open-ended, students are especially encouraged to operate in the Relational and Extended Abstract domains of the taxonomy.

We will talk about this during classes and meetings, but if you have any questions please raise them.
