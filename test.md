# Course Guide <a id="Course_Guide"></a>

ENGN2226 Systems Engineering Analysis fits into the Professional stream of the [BEng degree](http://studyat.anu.edu.au/programs/4700XBENG;requirements.html), and is compulsory for students in that degree program.

Aspects in ENGN2226 follows on from ENGN2225, but students can seek permission to do these courses out of sequence with minimal disruption.

### Course Outline 

The course uses multiple learning methods to develop students' ability to meet the Learning Outcomes, and Engineers Australia graduate competencies. These are detailed on the course's page on [StudyAt](http://studyat.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226;details.html).

**Variation to StudyAt Entry**

Please note that the indicative assessment is different to that confirmed in the [Assessment](#Assessment) section, and that there **is NO textbook** for this course (or for ENGN2226). All extra resources will be available on this site.

### Course Phases 

The course is divided into three stages:

*  Weeks 1-4: **Initial Group Design Project work**
*  Weeks 5-10: **Systems Engineering Methods**
*  Weeks 11-13: **Final Group Design Project work**

The [weekly topics schedule](#weekly_topics) has a detailed list of important times and dates.

### Assessment 

This course focusses on developing group problem solving skills, and a critical approach to problem solving using systems engineering methodologies. Different people learn in different ways, and accordingly the experience of the assessment will be slightly different for each student, especially in the Portfolio. Please see the [Assessment](#assessment) scheme for the information.

### Feedback 

Feedback is a process which is widely and fundamentally misunderstood. Marks are a key driver for students in courses, but feedback also ***drives*** systems. Unlike the mark, feedback shouldn't be an output or end result. Feedback on each task will be given within one week in most cases, to help you prepare for the next task. You should think of this 'feedback' as an input to your next learning task. 

### Expectations and Participation 

It is expected that you will attend all tutorials and all seminars. Tutorials - especially the ones run by your peers - are VERY difficult with low attendance, so please ensure that you can attend throughout the semester. 

Seminars are hands-on and will not be recorded, but any relevant notes will be made available. If you are unable to attend, please email Chris or your tutor to let them know. This is a common courtesy. You can expect feedback very promptly in this course - usually at the next session.

### Learning Activities 

The activity allocations will be made in the Week 2 Tutorial.

**Face-to-face Activities**

*  **Seminar** - to consolidate the week's topic content, there will be a seminar run by your lecturer. Bring your laptop, and expect to participate
*  **Tutorials** - Weeks 2-4 will have tutor-facilitated tutorials, which will provide an example for student-facilitated tutorials.
*  **Student-Facilitated Tutorials** - Weeks 5-10 will have student-facilitated tutorials. Every student will co-facilitate a tutorial of 60 minutes to their peers. Tutorial attendance is highly recommended, as non-facilitating students will be asked to engage in the material in a number of ways.
*  **Group mentoring** - tutors will act as mentors for your group project work, and will meet with you in weeks 5-10.
*  **Guest Lectures** - there will be occasional relevant guest lectures that students are invited along to. Your lecturer will advise about these as they come up.

**Online Activities**

*  **Online Lecturettes** - technical content will be provided through course videos and resources available on the [Course Content](content.html) pages
*  **Self-tests and further resources** - each lecturette will have a self-test to make sure that you're on the right track, and further resources to explore the topic
*  **Research and Peer Review** - facilitating students will work towards a research paper applying their project to their facilitation topic. Participating students will provide peer review comments twice throughout the semester on research papers.

### Expected Workload 

You are expected to engage in the course and the materials for approximately **10 hours per week**.

*  **Tutorials** - 2 hours (weeks 2-12)
*  **Seminars** - 2 hours (weeks 2-12)
*  **Workshop** - twice in the semester, 2 hours (weeks 4-9)
*  **Group Project work** - at least 2 hours per week is expected
*  **Individual Research** - 4 hours per week is expected, to cover the course material, extended research and individual tasks


### Learning Outcomes 

To be confirmed :)
  
### Group Work & Peer Evaluation 

Peer evaluation and comments will be a part of group work. You will be asked to mark the other members of your group, and marks will be moderated accordingly. Your group will be awarded a mark and the peer evaluation out of 10 will be applied to scale that mark for individuals. The course convener will override this if deemed necessary, in consultation with your tutor. This highlights the importance of working well both as a group, and within your group.

### Examiner's Discretion 
The course convener has examiner's discretion on your final grade. For ENGN2226, in principle, no discretion will be exercised unless you are close to a grade boundary - for example, you get 69.5% as a final grade. If you are in this scenario, the course convener will review your self-test attempts and make a decision based on these data. The course convener's decision is final, though you are entitled to appeal your grade according to the [Engineering Handbook](http://wattlearchive.anu.edu.au/mod/resource/view.php?id=421274.html)

### Course Rules and Policies 

As this course is run out of the Research School of Engineering, the relevant rules around word limits, late penalties and special consideration will be applied.

**If you have any issues, please talk to Chris early.**
