## Tips for a Great Presentation (or Discussion) ##
There are a number of things that you can do to get your idea across:

  * Be clear and rehearse your presentation
  * Avoid using a lot of text in your slides (use your own pictures as much as possible!)
  * Reference all diagrams or data
  * Keep slides uncluttered and relevant (avoid clip art and fancy designs!!)
  * The ANU template might be a good place to start. It's available on the [Marketing website](http://www.anu.edu.au/mo/content/site2/powerpoint).
  
## Research Paper resources

*  Please use the manuscript template listed on the [Assessment](assessment) task.
*  [Harvard Referencing](https://academicskills.anu.edu.au/resources/handouts/footnotes-endnotes-and-harvard-citations), from the Academic Skills and Learning Centre
*  [Resources for writing reports](https://academicskills.anu.edu.au/oweek), from ASLC
*  [Research skills](https://academicskills.anu.edu.au/resources/listing/95) - really valuable, including different types of sources.
*  [Abridged Harvard Referencing Guide](http://www.cqu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/14032/Abridged-Harvard-Referencing-guide-2013.pdf) from CQU... this is a great resource if you have no idea about referencing.
