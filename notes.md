### Seminar

Please note that the Thursday Seminar is not being held in Week 3. Newcomers please come to the Week 3 Workshop slot on Monday instead, and use the Seminar slot on Thursday to work on your group project.

## Wk4: Dynamical Systems

### Tutorial
This week's tutorial is the Group Project Roundtable.

### Seminar: Using Insightful Models - Home Insulation modelling and C-ROADS
*SMART+ Goal for this session: To play with dynamical models to match a reference mode, and understand the benefits and limitations of simulation.*

We'll get hands-on with models of two very different stock-and-flow models. First, a simple model of the temperature in a room, and then later using a model to forecast how to save the world from catastrophic climate change.

*  [Download ISEE Player Mac](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/isee_Player_10.0.3.dmg)
*  [Download Thermostat Models](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/Chapter2Thermostat.zip)

### Approach: Systems Thinking
There are a number great resources for understanding systems using systems thinking. We covered positive and negative feedback in ENGN2225, and in ENGN2226 we'll look at Stock & Flow modelling to understand these types of models in the seminar (this also might help you think about Queue Theory).

## Wk5: Human Factors

### Workshop Notes
[Download Chris' Secret Plan for the workshop.](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/notes/workshop_secret_plan-hf.pdf)

### Bonus Concept: Workplace Comfort
Some projects might not have a strong anthropometric or ergonomic component (or at least, not strong enough to write a research paper on). If this is the case, then you might want to explore other human-related measures, such as lighting or heating levels.

*  [WorkSafe ACT's Thermal Comfort Guidelines](http://www.worksafe.act.gov.au/page/view/1227)

### Tinker Seminar: Computer Keyboards are Slow
*SMART+ Goal for this session: To use population data and a statistical process to analyse a variety of computer keyboard layouts.*

How fast can you type? A computer keyboard is a fairly universal design solution for inputting text into a computer, but has it been designed with humans in mind? We'll test the traditional QWERTY layout against alternative layouts.

*  [Chris' worksheet for the activity](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/notes/seminar_worksheet_hf.pdf)
*  [Resources for running the keyboard activity](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/notes/seminar_notes-hf-keyboard.zip)
*  [Anonymous data collected during the session](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/notes/seminar_notes-hf-measurements.xls)
*  When we were analysing the data and 'graphing' it, we were using a [Statistical Process Chart](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/ENGN2226/notes_hf-blanchard-spc.pdf), which might be a useful platform for your analyses.

### Side note: Broken
<iframe class="thumbnail span4 pull-right" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/4246943?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="300" height="225" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

Who determines when and to what degree things are broken? The user does, of course. Seth Godin gives a great overview of how many systems are broken and what we should do to fix them in seven categories:

1. Not my job
1. Selfish jerks
1. The world changed
1. I don't know
1. I'm not a fish
1. Contradictions
1. Broken on purpose

## Wk6: Queue Theory

### Tutorial Notes
*  [Orientation notes from for QT topic (PDF)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/notes/tutorial_notes-qt.pdf)

### Workshop Notes
*  [Download Chris' Secret Plan for the workshop (PDF)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/notes/workshop_secret_plan-qt.pdf)

### Tinker Seminar: The Beer Game
*SMART+ Goal for this session: To test strategies on optimising a workflow of queues in a system.*

We'll play the Beer Game, a logistics game that matches supply of 'beer' with the demand from thirsty customers. We'll use Queue Theory to try and optimise the workflow.

*  [Beer Distribution Game on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game)

:
During the seminar the concept of JIT manufacturing came up. If you'd like to explore this and associated concepts, these are a few resources that could get you started.

*  The [Kanban method on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) - *kanban is a 'twin bin' method that reduces inventory on site*
*  Lean Manufacturing is also a JIT concept. [This video of a Boeing manufacturing line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_9WyiPhoHA) demonstrates lean manufacturing principles.
*  The wikipedia article on [Six Sigma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma) also gives a good overview of continuous improvement, which is another key aspect of JIT

## Wk7: Multifactorial Design

### Workshop Notes

*  [Chris' 'secret' plan for the MFD workshop](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/notes/workshop_secret_plan-mfd.pdf)

### Tutorial Notes

*  [Tutorial Notes on Multifactorial Design](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/notes/tutorial_notes-mfd.pdf)

### Tinker Seminar: Paper Aircraft 
Ever wondered what makes the best paper aeroplanes? Is it the materials, the design, or how well the folds are made? 

We'll conduct the DoE on a variety of paper aeroplane designs, to understand what parameters could be optimised for the best design.

*  [Hamza's Slides](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/notes/seminar_slides-mfd-hb.pdf) on *Automated Aerospace Composites Manufacturing*
*  [Chris's Worksheet for Paper Planes](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/notes/seminar_worksheet-mfd.pdf)

### Side Note: Reliability-Centered Maintenance
Note that not all products and systems observe the Bathtub curve, and with increasingly more complicated systems being developed all the time, the bathtub curve is increasingly becoming known as the "Bathtub Fallacy". Companies are instead opting for Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) as a method to improve the reliability of systems.

*  [*Reliability-Centered Maintenance*](http://homepages.laas.fr/kader/rcm.pdf) by Anthony M. Smith provides a great overview of Bathtub-to-RCM thinking.

### Side Note: MTBF & MTBM
When considering reliability, the likely failure rate is a useful factor in any analysis. [Blanchard & Fabrycky's section on reliability](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/ENGN2226/notes_mfd-blanchard-mtbf.pdf) cover Mean Time Before Failure and Mean Time Before Maintenance and associated concepts well.

### Extension: Design of Experiments (DoE)
The fundamental theory this week (DoE) gives us a methodology to navigate Techniques of reliability. When the interactions in systems are so complex that you can't see simple patterns of cause-and-effect, identifying some key parameters and analysing them can help you see their relationships.

### Tinker Seminar: Mobile Phone Teardown

This week we're going to document (photograph) the process of taking apart an old mobile phone. [MobileMuster](http://www.mobilemuster.com.au/) has kindly donated mobile phones, but we can try to revive an old phone you have lying around too. 

Note that if you'd like to fix the screen of a phone that you have broken, talk to Chris, buy the parts, and we can see what we can do :) 

A great resource for fixing modern electronics is [iFixit](http://ifixit.org).

### Side Note: The Story of Electronics

<iframe class="thumbnail span4 pull-right" width="300" height="225" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sW_7i6T_H78" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Annie Leonard has become somewhat of a folk-hero with her informed but personal stories of (un)sustainable consumption at [The Story of Stuff Project](http://www.storyofstuff.org/). Check out the Story of Electronics (and then make sure you come and fix your old phone :)

## Wk9: Energy-Mass Balance
### Workshop Notes
We're going to look at bottled water, and its alternatives.

### Tinker Seminar: Canberra's transport future
*Note that the Pedal Power example has moved to the Economic Analysis topic*

Canberra has a plan for its transport future, and we're going to investigate the Energy-Mass Balance aspects of these plans.

Relevant Resources:  
*  [ACT Government Transport Plan (2012)](http://www.transport.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/397245/Pages_from_EDS_ACT_Transport_Policy_FA_final_web.pdf)
*  [DRET's Energy Efficiency Opportunities: Transport (2010)](http://eeo.govspace.gov.au/files/2012/10/EMB-Transport.pdf)

And some reports that have some great ideas:
*  [Beyond Zero Emissions Zero Energy Transport Plan](http://bze.org.au/media/newswire/zero-carbon-transport-what-might-it-look-120802)
*  [ACT Greens Active Transport Plan](http://act.greens.org.au/sites/greens.org.au/files/ACT_Greens_Active_Transport_Plan.pdf)

We'll go through a modified process of creating an EMB plan:

1.  Develop a project plan
1.  Map the energy use in the system for two transport modes
1.  Discuss Data and Define Boundaries
1.  Construct a new map to address EMB efficiencies


### Side Note 1: Energy Savings Measurement Guide
While you're looking at the Energy-Mass Balance material on the [Energy Efficiency Opportunities](http://energyefficiencyopportunities.gov.au/) website, you should check out their [Energy Savings Measurement Guide](http://energyefficiencyopportunities.gov.au/guides/energy-savings-measurement/), which explores opportunities to improve energy efficiency in systems. [The Natural Edge Project](http://www.naturaledgeproject.net/whole_system_design.aspx)'s Whole System Design also highlights some worked examples of this style of system analysis.

### Side Note 2: Cradle-to-Cradle Design
<iframe class="thumbnail span4 pull-right" src="http://embed.ted.com/talks/william_mcdonough_on_cradle_to_cradle_design.html" width="300" height="225" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

What about designing a machine that can convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, stores large amounts of carbon, provide shade and a home to animals, releases nutrients into the ground... You get the idea. Check out William McDonough's video on Cradle-to-Cradle design, and reframe the way you think about waste.

## Wk10: Economic Analysis
### Tinker Seminar: Pedal Power - Business Case

In our topic Seminar, we're going to see what we can really power with pedals. A group from [Engineers Without Borders](http://ewb.org.au) has prepared an activity that converts pedal power into AC, allowing us to use it as a source of energy. We'll investigate the economic argument for pedal power.


We'll compare some economic models and come up with a business decision.
