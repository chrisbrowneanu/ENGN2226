### Seminar

Please note that the Thursday Seminar is not being held in Week 3. Newcomers please come to the Week 3 Workshop slot on Monday instead, and use the Seminar slot on Thursday to work on your group project.


## Wk4: Dynamical Systems

### Tutorial
This week's tutorial is the Group Project Roundtable.

### Seminar: Using Insightful Models - Home Insulation modelling and C-ROADS
*SMART+ Goal for this session: To play with dynamical models to match a reference mode, and understand the benefits and limitations of simulation.*

We'll get hands-on with models of two very different stock-and-flow models. First, a simple model of the temperature in a room, and then later using a model to forecast how to save the world from catastrophic climate change.

*  [Download Thermostat Models](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/Chapter2Thermostat.zip)

### Approach: Systems Thinking
There are a number great resources for understanding systems using systems thinking. We covered positive and negative feedback in ENGN2225, and in ENGN2226 we'll look at Stock & Flow modelling to understand these types of models in the seminar (this also might help you think about Queue Theory).

## Wk5: Human Factors

### Workshop Notes
[Download Chris' Secret Plan for the workshop.]((http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/workshop_secret_plan_hf.pdf)

### Bonus Concept: Workplace Comfort
Some projects might not have a strong anthropometric or ergonomic component (or at least, not strong enough to write a research paper on). If this is the case, then you might want to explore other human-related measures, such as lighting or heating levels.

*  [WorkSafe ACT's Thermal Comfort Guidelines](http://www.worksafe.act.gov.au/page/view/1227)

### Tinker Seminar: Computer Keyboards are Slow
*SMART+ Goal for this session: To use population data and a statistical process to analyse a variety of computer keyboard layouts.*

How fast can you type? A computer keyboard is a fairly universal design solution for inputting text into a computer, but has it been designed with humans in mind? We'll test the traditional QWERTY layout against alternative layouts.

### Side note: Broken

Who determines when and to what degree things are broken? The user does, of course. Seth Godin gives a great overview of how many systems are broken and what we should do to fix them in seven categories:

1. Not my job
1. Selfish jerks
1. The world changed
1. I don't know
1. I'm not a fish
1. Contradictions
1. Broken on purpose

## Wk6: Queue Theory

### Tutorial Notes
*  [Orientation notes from last week's tutorial (PDF)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/tutorial_notes.pdf)

### Workshop Notes
*  [Download Chris' Secret Plan for the workshop (PDF)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2226/current/data/workshop_secret_plan_qt.pdf)

### Tinker Seminar: The Beer Game
*SMART+ Goal for this session: To test strategies on optimising a workflow of queues in a system.*

We'll play the Beer Game, a logistics game that matches supply of 'beer' with the demand from thirsty customers. We'll use Queue Theory to try and optimise the workflow.

### Side Note 1: PERT Charts

### Side Note 2: Just it Time Manufacturing

Coming...

## Wk7: Multifactorial Design

### Workshop Notes

### Tutorial Notes

### Tinker Seminar: Paper Aircraft 
Ever wondered what makes the best paper aeroplanes? Is it the materials, the design, or how well the folds are made? 

We'll conduct the DoE on a variety of paper aeroplane designs, to understand what parameters could be optimised for the best design.

### Side Note: Reliability-Centered Maintenance
Note that not all products and systems observe the Bathtub curve, and with increasingly more complicated systems being developed all the time, the bathtub curve is increasingly becoming known as the "Bathtub Fallacy". Companies are instead opting for Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) as a method to improve the reliability of systems.

*  [*Reliability-Centered Maintenance*](http://homepages.laas.fr/kader/rcm.pdf) by Anthony M. Smith provides a great overview of Bathtub-to-RCM thinking.

### Side Note: MTBF & MTBM
When considering reliability XXX

### Tinker Seminar: Mobile Phone Teardown

This week we're going to document (photograph) the process of taking apart an old mobile phone. [MobileMuster](http://www.mobilemuster.com.au/) has kindly donated mobile phones, but we can try to revive an old phone you have lying around too. 

Note that if you'd like to fix the screen of a phone that you have broken, talk to Chris, buy the parts, and we can see what we can do :) 

A great resource for fixing modern electronics is [iFixit](http://ifixit.org).


### Side Note: The Story of Electronics

<iframe class="thumbnail span4 pull-right" width="300" height="225" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sW_7i6T_H78" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Annie Leonard has become somewhat of a folk-hero with her informed but personal stories of (un)sustainable consumption at [The Story of Stuff Project](http://www.storyofstuff.org/). Check out the Story of Electronics (and then make sure you come and fix your old phone :)

## Wk9: Energy-Mass Balance
### Workshop Notes

### Tutorial Notes

### Tinker Seminar: Pedal Power
In our penultimate Seminar, we're going to see what we can really power with pedals. A group from [Engineers Without Borders](http://ewb.org.au) has prepared an activity that converts pedal power into AC, allowing us to use it as a source of energy. We'll investigate the Energy-Mass Balance and where the energy losses occur in the system.

### Side Note 1: Energy Savings Measurement Guide
While you're looking at the Energy-Mass Balance material on the [Energy Efficiency Opportunities](http://energyefficiencyopportunities.gov.au/) website, you should check out their [Energy Savings Measurement Guide](http://energyefficiencyopportunities.gov.au/guides/energy-savings-measurement/), which explores opportunities to improve energy efficiency in systems. [The Natural Edge Project](http://www.naturaledgeproject.net/whole_system_design.aspx)'s Whole System Design also highlights some worked examples of this style of system analysis.

### Side Note 2: Cradle-to-Cradle Design
<iframe class="thumbnail span4 pull-right" src="http://embed.ted.com/talks/william_mcdonough_on_cradle_to_cradle_design.html" width="300" height="225" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

What about designing a machine that can convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, stores large amounts of carbon, provide shade and a home to animals, releases nutrients into the ground... You get the idea. Check out William McDonough's video on Cradle-to-Cradle design, and reframe the way you think about waste.

## Wk10: Economic Analysis
### Tinker Seminar: Business Case

We'll compare some economic models and come up with a business decision.
